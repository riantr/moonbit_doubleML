"""Round 51 dry-run: break the `ml_m` default contract seven ways, and watch the
verifier notice.

WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR
====================
A verifier that has never been seen to FAIL is not evidence.
`_verify/_verify_mlm_defaults_1650.py` derives the `ml_m` default split out of
the package and holds every live document that states it against that
derivation -- and a verifier that only ever prints "ok" is indistinguishable
from one that never fires.

So this driver copies the tree into a scratch clone, breaks the contract one
way at a time, and requires the failure count to GROW at every step.  A
contract nobody can break is a contract nobody is really checking.

THE MECHANISMS
===============
  1  TUNE_DESIGN's count goes stale again
  2  the README's count word no longer matches the list it publishes
  3  the README's list drops an estimator the package still defaults
  4  an estimator's `ml_m` default is flipped from a classifier to a regressor
  5  an `ml_m` default names a learner the package does not have
  6  the package's own classifier decision procedure changes its mind
  7  a `tune()` method is removed from an estimator that has one

WHAT IS COUNTED
===============
A failing CHECK.  The marker `*** FAIL ***` goes on each failing check line;
a line whose WHOLE content is the marker is a section HEADER some verifiers
print after their counter, and a header is not a check, so it is excluded.
The count is by CONTAINMENT, not by prefix or by suffix.

EVERY MECHANISM MUST ADD A NEW FAILURE
=======================================
A mechanism that trips a check that is ALREADY tripped is FLAT, and a flat
step means the mechanism is not being measured.  So the order below matters:
each step is chosen to fail at least one check no earlier step has failed.
